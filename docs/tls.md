# Transport Layer Security

Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor of the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible (Source: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)).
